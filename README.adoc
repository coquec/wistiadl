== Purpose

This script eases downloading videos from Wistia. Simply run the
script in the folder you want to leave the videos, specifying the
quality you want, and copy into the terminal where it's running the
HTML code you obtain by right clicking the video and selecting the
_Copy link and thumbnail_ option.

The script will deduce the video URL from the JSON in Witsia's servers
and will download it in the current directory.

== Installation

Simply clone the repo and make a link to the script in any folder
included in your PATH. For example:

----
$ git clone https://github.com/coquec/wistiadl.git
$ ln -s ~/wistiadl/wistiadl ~/bin
----

The script needs https://stedolan.github.io/jq/[jq] and
https://curl.se/[curl] installed in your system. Please, refer to the
documentation of these tools for further information.
